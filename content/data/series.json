The HDR drone shots in a forest reveal that this is a series that could only have been filmed in 2017. It's always hard to depict the supernatural without cringeworthy VFX, but Dark does a really good job keeping the viewer on their toes about what's going to happen next.","optimizedImage":[{"id":"attu5bWLOEIsi9ldJ","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/7bjS2YSByqc8gk4WEcOw_dark-netflix.jpg","filename":"dark-netflix.jpg","size":56672,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/HXcteXWSR6IxYIik299z_small_dark-netflix.jpg","width":72,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/awWVapxQzeArTo9mVD9C_large_dark-netflix.jpg","width":1024,"height":512}}}],"trailerLink":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zy0b9e40tK8"},"createdTime":"2017-12-24T11:35:41.000Z"},{"id":"rec9jBwLRRlIsCFZQ","fields":{"name":"Mindhunter","image":[{"id":"att8eZVWPEpzx2PJp","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/azvnxFzYRKCn3cAitvo1_mindhunter_netflix.jpg","filename":"mindhunter_netflix.jpg","size":80347,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/pLzezvzqSaG03eDvcOiz_small_mindhunter_netflix.jpg","width":64,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/j0CJtlP9TTq5Ni0LHWWZ_large_mindhunter_netflix.jpg","width":910,"height":512}}}],"platform":"Netflix","releaseDate":"2017-10-13","season":1,"description":"In the late 1970s two FBI agents expand criminal science by delving into the psychology of murder and getting uneasily close to all-too-real monsters.","review":"Looking back at it, it wasn't that special, but nonetheless I was hooked from the Fincher-directed first episode. Mindhunter follows 2 FBI agents trying to get into the minds of serial killers. This series reminded me of one of my favorite films ever: _The Zodiac_.

Some of the special FX in the S7 episodes bring GoT on par with the biggest Hollywood movies. I've never been one for investigating the backstory on this one and I am happy for that, because I'm sure they've butchered what was left of the original saga. Now you just take GoT for what it is: high-budget mindless entertainment that has its moments.","optimizedImage":[{"id":"attVRzqYXdImJLAcr","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/FsHq7Wu7Qz29xkZomR8J_game-of-thrones-s7.jpg","filename":"game-of-thrones-s7.jpg","size":126147,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/Hh1K8UQT4XB7yLyQL3gW_small_game-of-thrones-s7.jpg","width":54,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/IVBP8pkbS7Wxs7jEK2bC_large_game-of-thrones-s7.jpg","width":768,"height":512}}}],"trailerLink":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giYeaKsXnsI"},"createdTime":"2017-12-27T12:18:05.000Z"},{"id":"recZGeka3icORjxlV","fields":{"name":"Master of None","image":[{"id":"att8AhsIKL1MYfwIm","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/2FKyvSfFRQy2cLYpm1Kr_master_of_none_season_2.jpg","filename":"master_of_none_season_2.jpg","size":141559,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/AqVeAMmUSeql7U9KAu3f_small_master_of_none_season_2.jpg","width":54,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/1HOeDpZRQFWrtBSxfezC_large_master_of_none_season_2.jpg","width":768,"height":512}}}],"platform":"Netflix","releaseDate":"2017-05-12","season":2,"description":"The personal and professional life of Dev, a 30-year-old actor in New York.","review":"This seems to be quite polarizing, where some people think this is VERY boring and others think it's brilliant.
