Zelda: Breath of the Wild challenges what a Zelda game can be, while still being a _Zelda_ game at heart. I've yet to play the DLCs, but if you have the chance to play the base game, please give it a chance."},"createdTime":"2017-12-24T11:35:45.000Z"},{"id":"recuUrAasz6sJbDhO","fields":{"releaseDate":"2017-08-02","platforms":["Nintendo Switch"],"name":"Overcooked","image":[{"id":"attvvIXKycgtJXMUh","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/Umz1q73iQ25V6aKoGdR7_large.jpg","filename":"large.jpg","size":153559,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/ocOSHOZQc2h8FkfwYpyQ_small_large.jpg","width":64,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/uJf6nTuZRwegjCoqMlj9_large_large.jpg","width":905,"height":512}}}],"review":"There's so few games to play on the couch with friends. Honestly, try searching both the Playstation and the Switch store for titles that you can play with 4 persons. There's almost nothing to be found. Luckily, there is Overcooked.

Next to _Dirt: Rally_ (2016) I've played quite a bit of _GT: Sport_ and boy, for me, it is awesome. Stunning visuals, an interesting (albeit a bit flawed) online competitive mode, and lots of tutorials for how to be a better driver."},"createdTime":"2017-12-24T13:30:11.000Z"},{"id":"recn28zMfSDoXJecF","fields":{"releaseDate":"2017-10-27","platforms":["Nintendo Switch"],"name":"Super Mario: Odyssey","review":"I'm a bit hesitant to include this one. Did I like it or not? Why did the credits roll so early? Was it really fun? I'm not sure. _Super Mario 64_ was the video game that made me a gamer - so was this a blast of nostalgia?\n\nThere's nothing wrong with this game. It's well made and provides a lot of variety. I'm just not sure if I care anymore, especially if I pit it next to Breath of the Wild.","image":[{"id":"atti1wyUHfkrcCvhh","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/WOxiQUN3SUGjRd66n6vy_718xprkSOyL._SL1280_.jpg","filename":"718xprkSOyL._SL1280_.jpg","size":154886,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/Tlf3lEfgRuKPmzySXCaC_small_718xprkSOyL._SL1280_.jpg","width":64,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/ycbmJl2pTm6pauQpS1Oy_large_718xprkSOyL._SL1280_.jpg","width":910,"height":512}}}]},"createdTime":"2017-12-24T13:31:54.000Z"},{"id":"recedg6hWPtlouaOZ","fields":{"releaseDate":"2017-08-22","platforms":["PS4"],"name":"Uncharted: The Lost Legacy","image":[{"id":"attoIq3TY1nSXGY4l","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/vfTw6HcpTA6TTWiOi6nZ_uncharted_lost_legacy_review_1.0.jpg","filename":"uncharted_lost_legacy_review_1.0.jpg","size":71776,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/eKMgjv9uTm2EBK8ahwDB_small_uncharted_lost_legacy_review_1.0.jpg","width":64,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/0MCx3E6XTKBBJRzqORQx_large_uncharted_lost_legacy_review_1.0.jpg","width":910,"height":512}}}],"review":"I picked this one up as a â‚¬19.99 sale.
